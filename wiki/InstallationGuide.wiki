#summary Basic installation guide for subHooker
#labels Featured

=Requirements=

  * Java 1.6 Runtime Environment Installed, properly configured.
 
=Installing subHooker=

 subHooker is fairly simple to setup. After downloading subHooker, you'll extract the ZIP file to your repository's hooks folder. You'll end up with a new folder under Hooks, called subHooker-x.x.x, where x.x.x represents the version number. Simply point your precommit.bat or post-commit.bat file to subHooker-x.x.x\bin\subhooker.bat. This line would look something like so under a windows computer:

  * pre-commit: 
{{{
call %~dp0\subHooker-2.1.0\bin\subhooker.bat pre %1 %2 
}}}
  * post-commit: 
{{{
call %~dp0\subHooker-2.1.0\bin\subhooker.bat post %1 %2
}}}

=Configuring subHooker= 

The configuration of subHooker has varing depths depending on your needs: 

==Basic==

If you want simple functionality and basic post-commit e-mail messages you need only provide a SMTP Host, port and if necessary a username and password for SMTP Authorization. This is accomplished by editing the subHooker.properties file, which is located under in the subHooker folder, under the etc directory:
{{{..\hooks\subhooker-2.1.0\etc\subHooker.properties}}}

Edit the following lines, providing the necessary information:

{{{
mail.server.protocol=smtp
mail.server.name=mysmtpserver.company.com
mail.server.port=25
mail.server.useAuth=false
mail.user.auth.name=
mail.user.auth.password=
mail.user.fromAddress=noreply@someaddress.com
mail.message.subjectTag=SVN
mail.message.format=HTML
}}}

The table below explains each of the settings:

||*mail.server.protocol*||This controls the transport used by the SMTP class. This option has not been tested woth other protocols yet and should be left alone.||
||*mail.server.name*||The name of your outbound Mail server.||
||*mail.server.port*||This is the port your mail server can be reached on, the default for most SMTP Servers is 25||
||*mail.server.useAuth*||If set to true you must fill out user name and password fields (below). The client will use Authentication to send email.||
||*mail.user.auth.name*||The user name who has send capabilities on the mail server||
||*mail.user.auth.password*||The Password of the above user.||
||*mail.user.fromAddress*||This is the e-mail address that the post-commit e-mail will be 'from', usually a noreply address or the subversion administrators e-mail address.||
||*mail.message.subjectTag*||This will be prepended to the subject of the e-mail, which also contains the name of the committer and the revision number||
||*mail.message.format*||This currently supports two options <ul><li>HTML - send nicely formatted HTML email messages</li><li>TEXT - send plain text email messages</li></ul> ||

Next you'll want to configure the subversion properties, this is also done while under the etc directory at:
{{{
..\hooks\subhooker-2.1.0\etc\subHooker.properties
}}}

You'll want to edit the following properties:

{{{
svn.lookPath=c:\\Program Files\\Subversion\\bin\\svnlook.exe
svn.recipiantList=C:\\somepath\\emaillist.txt
svn.nagNoLogCommits=true
svn.precommit.CommitLogManditory=true
svn.precommit.CommitLogMinLength=20
svn.precommit.BliOrDefectNumberRequired=false
svn.precommit.BliRegex=([bBdD]\-[0-9]{5})
}}}

The table below explains each setting:

|| svn.lookPath || This is the path to SVNLOOK, windows should use double back-slashes in the path, like<br> C:\\Program Files\\Subversion\\bin\\svnlook.exe||
|| svn.recipiantList || The full path to a plain text file of e-mail recipiants, one e-mail address per line||
|| svn.`nagNoLogCommits`|| If this is set to true, and you allow authors to commit code with no commit message, this will insert a NAG line like <br>"The author of this code commit chose not to post a useful comment" ||
|| svn.precommit.`CommitLogManditory` || If this is set to true, code commits with no commit log will be rejected.||
|| svn.precommit.`CommitLogMinLength` || If set, this will reject any code commit not containing the minimal amount of characters (not words, but characters)||
|| svn.precommit.`BliOrDefectNumberRequired` || If this is set to true, then the authors commit message must contain a match to the Regular expression, shown below.||
|| svn.precommit.`BliRegex` || A standard Java Regular Expression, if required, the authors commit message must contain text matching the regular Expression, see below||

 If you set `BliOrDefectNumberRequired` to true, subHooker will perform a Regular Expression search of the Authors commit log, and will expect that there is a match. For example the following regular expression string :

{{{
([bBdD]\-[0-9]{5})
}}}
 ...will return true if any of the following strings exist in the authors commit message:
 
*B-01234* or *b-90122* or *d-12345* or *D-99119*

Lastly choose if you want to have DIFF and Change Lists in the e-mail by modifying the last two options:

{{{
email.contents.show.diff=true
email.contents.show.changeset=true
}}}
