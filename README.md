# subhooker
subHooker is a script-free pre-commit and post-commit hook package that substantially eases the configuration of subversion post-commit e-mail messages. It requires no external Perl scripts, no external mail clients. subHooker uses a properties file, simply configure it, and call it from your existing hook. If you want to get more advanced, it supports a complete HTML or plain text based e-mail template system.
